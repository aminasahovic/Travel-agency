# Travel-agency

### Introduction

This project was developed in collaboration with my colleague, [@marichusein](https://github.com/marichusein)
, as part of the Software Development course at our university. It focuses on building a comprehensive management system for a travel agency. The application caters to three types of users:

1. **Registered Users**: These users have the capability to make reservations and browse available offers.
2. **Administrators**: They have basic administrative privileges, allowing them to perform essential administrative tasks.
3. **Regular Employees**: They have the ability to generate specific information or perform tasks within the system.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: The backend of this application is developed using the .NET framework.
- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using Angular, providing an interactive and dynamic experience.

### How to Use

1. **Setting Up the Backend**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Navigate to the `TuristickaAgencija` directory and run the following commands:
     ```shell
     dotnet restore
     dotnet run
     ```
     This will start the backend server.

2. **Setting Up the Frontend**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following commands:
     ```shell
     npm install
     ng serve
     ```
     This will start the Angular development server.

3. **Accessing the Application**
   - Open your preferred web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the application.
